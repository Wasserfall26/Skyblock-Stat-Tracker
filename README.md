# Skyblock-Stat-Tracker

Are you tired of NEU profile viewer 
being slow, but there also isn’t a nice 
alternative for 1.21?

Fear not! I have made an Application 
that lets you check the Stats of 
Skyblock Players while in Minecraft and 
also while not in Minecraft.

It allows clicking on Names in chat
and also has a hotkey for opening
the Application so you can type the 
name (also there still is a command)
To satisfy all your needs

Versions soon to be available:

1.8.9
1.21

How it works:
The Mod acts as a bridge to tell the 
Name you give it (or if you just press 
the hotkey, that you want to open it)
to a python skript, which uses the API
to tell you about the Player.

By default you press P to open or in 
chat hold ALT + Click on Name


If you have any suggestions feel free 
to DM me.
